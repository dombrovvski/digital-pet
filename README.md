# digital-pet

##My digital pet is very tempermental. It hates the color green, is neutral about blue, and looooooves red, so you can watch its face change when it sees each color. It even texts me when it sees something super red!


###It also hates the cold, so if the weather report says that tomorrow's low will be below 50F, my pet throws a little temper tantrum.
